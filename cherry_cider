- **0.5 gallons** pure cherry juice (no added sugars or preservatives)

### Instructions:

1. **Sanitize** all equipment thoroughly before starting.

2. **Primary Fermentation:**
   - In the bottling bucket, pour in the 5 gallons of apple juice and 0.5 gallons of cherry juice.
   - Add the pectic enzyme, stirring well to distribute evenly (this helps with clarity).
   - Pitch the cider yeast according to the packet instructions, then seal the bucket with an airlock.

3. **Fermentation Duration:**
   - Ferment at **65-70°F (18-21°C)** for about **2 weeks**, or until the fermentation noticeably slows.

4. **Secondary Flavor Addition:**
   - After primary fermentation, carefully **rack** (transfer) the cider into a clean, sanitized vessel, leaving behind as much sediment as possible.
   - Add the **1 cup of cherry concentrate** to boost the cherry flavor.

5. **Clarifying and Racking:**
   - Leave the cider in secondary for an additional **7-10 days**. 
   - Check clarity; if still hazy, add **0.5 tsp of a fining agent** (like gelatin) for additional clearing.

6. **Filtering and Kegging:**
   - Carefully **filter** the cider during the transfer into your keg, aiming to leave any remaining sediment behind.
   - Once in the keg, pressurize with **CO2** and carbonate for 7-10 days at **10-12 PSI**.

7. **Aging:**
   - For optimal clarity and flavor, condition the cider in the keg for at least **2 weeks** before serving.
