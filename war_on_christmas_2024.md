# Eggnog-Flavored Milk Stout Recipe (5.5 Gallons)

## Ingredients
- **6.6 lbs** Light Liquid Malt Extract (LME)
- **2 lbs** Dark Dry Malt Extract (DME)
- **1.25 lbs** Lactose (milk sugar, for sweetness and body)
- **1.25 lbs** Crystal Malt (80L) (for caramel notes)
- **0.6 lb** Chocolate Malt (for chocolate and roasted notes)
- **0.6 lb** Roasted Barley (for deep color and roasted flavor)
- **0.5 lb** Flaked Barley (for head retention)
- **1.25 oz** East Kent Goldings hops (bittering, 60 minutes)
- **1.25 oz** Fuggle hops (aroma, 10 minutes)
- **1 tsp** Irish moss or Whirlfloc tablet (optional, for clarity)
- **2 packets** high-alcohol tolerant yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale or White Labs WLP007 Dry English Ale yeast)
- **1.5-2 oz** Eggnog flavoring extract (to be added at kegging; adjust to taste)
- **CO₂** for carbonation

## Instructions

### Step 1: Steep the Specialty Grains
1. Heat 3.5 gallons of water to 155°F (68°C).
2. Place the Crystal Malt, Chocolate Malt, Roasted Barley, and Flaked Barley in a grain bag.
3. Steep the grain bag in the heated water for 20–30 minutes, maintaining a temperature of 155°F.
4. Remove and discard the grain bag, letting any liquid drip back into the kettle.

### Step 2: Add Malt Extract and Lactose
1. Remove the kettle from heat and add the **Light Liquid Malt Extract (LME)**, **Dark Dry Malt Extract (DME)**, and **lactose**. Stir thoroughly until all extracts are fully dissolved.
2. Return the kettle to heat and bring the wort back to a boil.

### Step 3: Boil and Hop Schedule
1. **60 minutes**: Add 1.25 oz of East Kent Goldings hops for bitterness.
2. **15 minutes left**: Add Irish moss or Whirlfloc tablet (optional, to help with clarity).
3. **10 minutes left**: Add 1.25 oz of Fuggle hops for aroma.
4. Once the boil is complete, turn off the heat.

### Step 4: Cool and Transfer to Stainless Steel Fermentor
1. Use a wort chiller or an ice bath to cool the wort rapidly to about 65–70°F (18–21°C).
2. Transfer the cooled wort to your stainless steel fermentor, topping up with water to reach a total of 5.5 gallons if necessary.
3. **Pressurize the fermentor to around 10-15 PSI** and secure the lid. This controlled pressure will help with carbonation during fermentation.
4. Aerate the wort briefly by stirring or shaking gently, as yeast still requires some oxygen to begin fermentation.

### Step 5: Pitch Yeast and Begin Pressurized Fermentation
1. Pitch the yeast once the wort reaches a stable 65–70°F.
2. Maintain the temperature at 65–70°F throughout fermentation.
3. Allow fermentation to proceed for about 2–3 weeks. The stainless steel fermentor will build some pressure naturally as fermentation progresses.

### Step 6: Kegging and Carbonation
1. Once primary fermentation completes (check with a hydrometer to confirm stable final gravity around 1.020–1.024), transfer the beer directly to a sanitized keg.
2. Add **1.5 oz of eggnog flavoring extract** to the keg, stir well, and taste-test. Add more if desired, up to 2 oz total.
3. Seal the keg and pressurize with CO₂. Carbonate to around 1.8–2.2 volumes of CO₂ for a creamy mouthfeel.
4. Chill the keg and allow it to condition and carbonate fully over 1-2 weeks.
